<li><b>Empty Portfolio:</b> Resume lacks projects that major players crave.</li>
<li><b>Skills Mismatch:</b> Lacking the industry required skills for your dream job.</li>
<li><b>Low Profile Score:</b> Your Resume and LinkedIn May Not Meet Top Company Standards.</li>
<li><b>Guidance Gap:</b>You don't have access to mentors to guide your path.</li>
<li><b>AI Hurdle:</b> Bots tossing out your resume before human eyes see it.</li>
